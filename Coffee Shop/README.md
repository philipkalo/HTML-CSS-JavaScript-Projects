This folder contains the HTML and CSS files for the digital menu of a coffee shop. 

For HTML, this project involved inserting the actual data, adding images to the menu in the form of icons, creating anchor elements to enhance navigation in the company's media and allocating the different elements into classes. 

CSS constituted the biggest part of this project, as creating the menu involved making significant edits in font size, style, and text alignment, as well as the margins and paddings of different blocks and element, the background colours and images, etc.
